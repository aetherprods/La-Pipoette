# La-Pipoette
Lightweight Box Game. Props to Ã‰douard Lucas.

React application rendered server side by Next.JS using Express.JS for the server. Live app currently uses Pusher (https://pusher.com/) to provide real-time interactive gameplay and chat functionality. Latest build implements a Websocket server and serves it over the ExpressJS server. Currently held back by some issues.
